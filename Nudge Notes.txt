Deleted old branch made new one put in what I couldn't and what was lost to master: 
*Added player head bobbing when moving. 
*Changed player's speed to match the head bobbing. 
*Changed Camera position to match the body collision 
*Keycard input to pick it up 

Noticed:That keycard spawner doesn't let KeyCard blueprint work when trying to interact with it.
